# Library

Instructions for team members to use:
Clone repo and open folder in vs code, then
inside the root directory, do "npm install" in command prompt, this will install all the modules listed in the dependencies under package.json.

To run, do:
nodemon index.js
and go to localhost:3000 on google chrome.

When you make changes, do not push the node_modules folder, keep that on your own machine, and work on your own branch.
