# Library

Instructions for team members to use:
Clone repo and open folder in vs code, then
inside the root directory, do "npm install" in command prompt, this will install all the modules listed in the dependencies under package.json.

Install nodemon via "npm install -g nodemon"
Install fetch via "npm install node-fetch@2"
To run, do:
"nodemon index.js" on command prompt in the same directory
and go to localhost:3000 on google chrome.

When you make changes, do not push the node_modules folder, keep that on your own machine, and **work on your own branch**.
